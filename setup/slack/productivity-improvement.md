# productivity improvement
- slackをチラチラ気にしすぎてしまうため、アプリはデスクトップ版ではなくブラウザ版を使う。
- Use the sidebar to sort channels you want to keep up with into the Priority section and the rest into the default Channels.
  - Use the mute and display functions to avoid looking at slack as much as possible.
- Hide sidebars!
